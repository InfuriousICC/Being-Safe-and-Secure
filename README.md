## What is a cybercrime

Cybercrime, also called computer crime, refers to any illegal activity carried out using computers or the internet.

When you hear the word ‚Äúcybercriminal‚Äù or ‚Äúhacker,‚Äù what image comes to mind? Is it a sketchy guy, perhaps wearing a dark hoodie, camped out in a dank basement somewhere, typing away furiously? While that image is in the public consciousness thanks to movies and TV, the real picture of a cybercriminal is much different: cybercrime is incredibly organized and professionalized.

## Types of Cybercrime

1. Phising - 

This type of attack involves hackers sending malicious email attachments or URLs to users to gain access to their accounts or computer. Cybercriminals are becoming more established and many of these emails are not flagged as spam. Users are tricked into emails claiming they need to change their password or update their billing information, giving criminals access.

2. Identity Theft -

This cybercrime occurs when a criminal gains access to a user‚Äôs personal information to steal funds, access confidential information, or participate in tax or health insurance fraud. They can also open a phone/internet account in your name, use your name to plan a criminal activity and claim government benefits in your name. They may do this by finding out user‚Äôs passwords through hacking, retrieving personal information from social media, or sending phishing emails.

3. Banking Frauds -

Bank fraud is the illegal attempt of gaining access to the money and assets of a bank or its clients.
Bank fraud can be defined as an unethical and/or criminal act by an individual or organization to illegally attempt to possess or receive money from a bank or financial institution
The most common example of banking frauds are credit card frauds in which a cybercriminal either withdrawls the money or use someone else credit for online shopping.

4. Blackmailing -

Blackmail is an act of coerion using the threat of revealing or publicizing either substantially true or false information about a person or people unless certain demands are met. It is often damaging information, and may be revealed to family members or associates rather than to the general public. It may involve using threats of physical, mental or emotional harm, or of criminal prosecution, against the victim or someone close to the victim. It is normally carried out for personal gain, most commonly of position, money, or property.

5. Online Threats -

Cybersecurity threats are acts performed by individuals with harmful intent, whose goal is to steal data, cause damage to or disrupt computing systems. Common categories of cyber threats include malware, social engineering, man in the middle (MitM) attacks, denial of service (DoS), and injection attacks
Cyber threats can originate from a variety of sources, from hostile nation states and terrorist groups, to individual hackers, to trusted individuals like employees or contractors, who abuse their privileges to perform malicious acts.

6. Malware Attacks -

A malware attack is a common cyberattack where malware (normally malicious software) executes unauthorized actions on the victim's system. The malicious software (a.k.a. virus) encompasses many specific types of attacks such as ransomware, spyware, command and control, and more.


7. Cyberstalking -

This kind of cybercrime involves online harassment where the user is subjected to a plethora of online messages and emails. Typically cyberstalkers use social media, websites and search engines to intimidate a user and instill fear. Usually, the cyberstalker knows their victim and makes the person feel afraid or concerned for their safety.

8. Leaking Confidential Data -

Data leakage is the unauthorized transmission of data from within an organization to an external destination or recipient. The term can be used to describe data that is transferred electronically or physically.
Data leakage threats usually occur via the web and email, but can also occur via mobile data storage devices such as optical media, USB keys, and laptops.

9. Online Scams -

These are usually in the form of ads or spam emails that include promises of rewards or offers of unrealistic amounts of money. Online scams include enticing offers that are ‚Äútoo good to be true‚Äù and when clicked on can cause malware to interfere and compromise information.
